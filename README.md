 2). Communication System
 
Basically, we use the communication system to  communicate among rescue teams
Communication System manly has two parts

            1). Communication device            
            2). Gateway 
     Communication device 
     
            These devices use by rescue teams and use to send messages among other rescue teams and also
            if necessary can send messages to web server thru a gateway
            
            each device has Lora Node(E32-TTL-100) with Arduino Mega 2560
     Gateway
     
           these devices use to send messages outside network (From rescue teams to web server)        
           each deevice has Lora Node(E32-TTL-100) , GPRS module(sim900) and Arduino Mega 2560
           
Lora(E32-TTL-100) Range is (3-4KM)

We write simple Protocol to stop looping and data losing
